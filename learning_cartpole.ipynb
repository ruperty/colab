Each level has a single weight (gain) value which governs the performance of the control unit.\n","\n","Previously those weights were chosen by hand, so may not necessarily be the best. This current demo shows how those weights can be automatically optimised by a process of reorganisation (learning). In this case, reorganisation means changing the weight values based upon the global error within the system to improve performance. The global error encapsulates all the errors within each control system in the hierarchy. The lower this error then the more stable is the control of the Cartpole. \n","\n","As explained in the Advanced section, in this demo, this is achieved by implementing a Perceptual Control Theory hierarchy within Tensorflow, the Deep Learning framework.\n","\n","However, before going in to details let's first see it running.
